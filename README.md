# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Course - Shahid Beheshti University

## Overview
This repository houses the projects and assignments I completed during the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) course (2022) at Shahid Beheshti University as part of my Bachelor's program. The course covered a wide range of neural network architectures and techniques, with a strong emphasis on both theoretical concepts and practical applications using PyTorch.

The main objective of the course was to build a robust foundation in neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and advanced models like EfficientNet, ResNet, and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The assignments were designed to apply this knowledge through hands-on projects using well-known datasets such as Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Intel Image Classification.

Below is a summary of the five key assignments, each focusing on different aspects of neural networks, combining theoretical insights with practical implementation.
